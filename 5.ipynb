    "The intuition behind the Gradient Boosting algorithm lies in the concept of sequentially improving the performance of a model by learning from the mistakes of previous models. Here's a more detailed explanation of the intuition behind Gradient Boosting:\n",
    "\n",
    "Error Minimization: Gradient Boosting aims to minimize the error of a model by iteratively fitting weak learners (typically decision trees) to the residuals (the differences between the actual and predicted values) of the previous model. By focusing on the residuals, the subsequent models learn to correct the mistakes made by the previous models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Gradient Descent: The term \"gradient\" in Gradient Boosting refers to the gradient of the loss function with respect to the predictions of the model. In each iteration, the algorithm computes the gradient of the loss function for the current model's predictions. This gradient indicates the direction in which the predictions need to be adjusted to minimize the loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "Gradient Update: The algorithm then fits a weak learner (e.g., decision tree) to the negative gradient of the loss function. This means that the weak learner is trained to predict the direction and magnitude of the adjustment needed to minimize the loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "Model Combination: After training the weak learner, its predictions are combined with the predictions of the previous models. This combination is done in such a way that the overall model focuses more on reducing the errors of the combined ensemble.\n",
    "\n",
    "Learning Rate: A learning rate parameter controls the contribution of each new weak learner to the ensemble. A lower learning rate makes the model more conservative by reducing the impact of each new weak learner, while a higher learning rate allows the model to learn faster but may lead to overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regularization: Gradient Boosting includes regularization techniques to prevent overfitting, such as limiting the depth of the weak learners (tree depth) or adding a penalty term to the loss function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sequential Improvement: By iteratively adding new weak learners and adjusting the predictions based on the errors of the previous models, Gradient Boosting gradually improves the overall model's performance. Each new weak learner focuses on the remaining errors, leading to a reduction in the overall loss over time."
